# Problem Description
Retail technology businesses, such as Best Buy, face challenges in efficiently managing inventory, sales transactions, and product categorization. Without an organized database system, these businesses may encounter difficulties such as:
Overstocking or understocking due to poor inventory tracking.
Inefficient sales tracking, leading to unclear insights on employee performance and product demand.
Difficulty in categorizing products, which slows down retrieval and impacts customer service.
Lack of visibility into sales trends, making it harder for management to optimize stock levels and pricing strategies.
To address these challenges, the Electronic Product Database is designed as a comprehensive inventory and sales tracking system. This database will:
Store detailed product information, including descriptions, pricing, warranty periods, and brand associations.
Track real-time inventory status, restock dates, and reorder quantities.
Facilitate sales transactions, recording employee sales contributions, transaction amounts, and payment methods.
Enable sales analysis, allowing management to identify top-selling products, evaluate employee performance, and forecast future demand.
By implementing this database, businesses can improve inventory accuracy, sales efficiency, and data-driven decision-making to enhance overall operations.
